Exercise 34

a) supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning
b) Task: Predict continuous output variable from input
   Experience: (x,y) examples
   Performance: Root Mean Squared Error
c) Training-Data is "seen" by Algorithm;
   Test-Data is new to Algorithm and therefore used for evaluation
d) To prevent overfitting;
   Test-Data was chosen random out of all Data-Points in set
f) To have a convex function (which is differentiable) with a unique minimum (for optimizazion)
g) "Gradient-descent" to find Minimum;
   Cost-Function =: J
   Parameters of regression Function =: w,b
h) The learning rate prevents the Algorithm from "taking a too big step" when calculating a new parameter w
